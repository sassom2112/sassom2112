- [Regression Optimization](https://github.com/sassom2112/module_1_regression_optimization) - A project that explores manually fitting vs automatic fitting using gradient descent optimization for linear regression.
- [Training a Single Neuron Classifier](https://github.com/sassom2112/fuzzy-palm-tree.git) - A project that addresses a binary classification problem, predicting wine color (red or white) based on chemical features like acidity and alcohol content. It compares two approaches: manual implementation vs. scikit-learn, demonstrating the convenience and efficiency of using pre-built machine learning tools.
